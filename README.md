# Spatial machine-learning model diagnostics: a model-agnostic distance-based approach

This repository contains code and data supporting the following article, which should be cited when using this material:

- Brenning, A. (2023): Spatial machine-learning model diagnostics: a model-agnostic distance-based approach. *International Journal of Geographical Information Science* 37: 584â€“606, DOI: [10.1080/13658816.2022.2131789](https://doi.org/10.1080/13658816.2022.2131789).

This repository accompanies the IJGIS paper.
The next step will be to migrate the code into the `sperrorest` package (https://github.com/giscience-fsu/sperrorest), adding user-level functions for the calculation of spatial prediction error profiles (SPEPs) and spatial variable importance profiles (SVIPs) and their visualization.

The file `code_data.pdf` describes the structure and workflow of thhis repository.
